Stratagem Hero Desktop

Thank you for your interest in Stratagem Hero Desktop! Please note that this version you are viewing/downloading is a raw build and may not work out of the box. It requires dependencies that are not publicly available.

Installation

To use this application, please download and run the installer provided. The installer installs various dependencies to the C: drive. While this may seem risky, let me explain what it's installing.

The website from which this game originated stores all SVGs and JS dependencies on the C: drive for reasons unknown. Due to personal reasons, I haven't modified the code to change the image paths. It's a complex task that involves navigating through thousands of lines of HTML, which I haven't tackled yet.

Disclaimer

Please proceed with caution and understand that this build may not function as expected without the necessary dependencies. Feel free to reach out for assistance or updates on the progress of resolving these issues.
Though the installer says you can change the destination of the install it is not recommended to do so as it will break the game and the icons for stratagems will not show up. However, if you would like to you can copy the following folders into the C: Drive _next, assets and icons. Doing so will hopefully fix the issues. You will most likely have to do this if the installer fails.

Thank you for your understanding and support!
If anyone finds the original creator of the website please let me know and I will provide proper credit. Please remember I didn't not make the original website nor do I take credit for it.
